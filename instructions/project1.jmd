# Project \#1 - Semester 2, 2025
# Univariate Polynomials with Integer Coefficients
 
(last edit: September 9, 2025)
 
**Due:** Friday, 26, September, 2025 at 4pm. Late submissions are not accepted.
 
**Individual work:** This is an individual work assignment. Plagiarism will not be accepted. Nevertheless, feel free to consult with friends or classmates via Ed and other means about how to go about certain tasks. Note that similar and not identical projects were issued in previous editions of the course. If you wish, you may look at GitHub repos of such projects from previous years (in case students made them public). Do not copy code from those repos directly - but rather use such code bases for help as needed.
 
**Note:** The teaching staff will only answer questions (via ED, consultation hour, or practicals) regarding this assignment up to the evening of Thursday 25/9.
 
**Weights and marking criteria:** Total number of points: **100**. There are 10 points for setting up the GitHub repo properly and following instructions for hand-in (including voice recording). The remaining **90** points are for the project tasks.
 
**Submission format:** This assignment should be submitted via a GitHub Repo and a PDF file via Blackboard.
 
Specific instructions for the GitHub repo are below. It is important that the GitHub repo be made **private** and the course user name `MATH2504-staff-2025` be invited as a collaborator. It is also important to name the repo exactly as `<<FIRST NAME>>-<<LAST NAME>>-2504-2025-PROJECT1`. So for example if your name is "Pierre-Simon Laplace", the repo name should be `Pierre-Simon-Laplace-2504-2025-PROJECT1`.
 
The PDF must have the following compents.
 
1.  Your name, student number, and assignment title (Project 1 - 2025) on the top.
2.  A (clickable) link to your GitHub repo.
3.  A screenshot or copy/paste of output for each `example_script_task_i.jl`.
4.  A screenshot or copy/paste the output of `test/runtests.jl`.
 
The main body of the PDF file is then an indication of each location of the code project where you made changes and improvements, in view of the tasks below. That is, present the new snippets of code that you created and indicate what they do via brief descriptions. It is also a place to answer any questions that require output, or description.
 
The recommended way to make the PDF file is via a Jupyter notebook where you copy in some code and output into the notebook, and in certain cases use `include()` to run Julia code if appropriate. You also comment on questions in this PDF (e.g. when asked to answer things not via code). If desired you could keep this jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) in the repo. However, this Jupyter notebook will not be checked (only the PDF file), and it isn't required to be a "runnable" notebook. In any case, please avoid pixilated screenshots of code, so for example if you choose to format your PDF file in MS-word (instead of Jupyter), make sure the code is clean, formatted, and readable.
 
Marking responses will be made by the teaching staff by annotating **selected parts** of your PDF file via blackboard. The teaching staff will also inspect your GitHub repo. A very readable and clean PDF file is important. Note that in printing Jupyter to PDF (or exporting to PDF) there may sometimes be excessive white space. Do not worry about this extra white space; it is not a problem.
 
**Marking Criteria**:
 
* 10 points are allocated for setting up the GitHub hand-in according to the instructions and following the submission instructions.
 
* 90 points are for the polynomial project itself. Points are awarded for completing each of the tasks with full marks given to clean readable code that completes the task.
 
* In general, points **will be** deducted for sloppy coding style. Make sure to have your code properly indented, to use sensible and consistent variable names, and to write code that is in general clean and consistent.
 
---
 
## Setting up your GitHub repo for hand-in (10pts):
 
* Ideally use the same account you used for BigHW.
* Ideally we would like you to **fork** the GitHub repo [https://github.com/dietmaroelz/2504\_2025\_project1](https://github.com/dietmaroelz/2504_2025_project1). The new forked repo under your GitHub account should then be made private. However, GitHub does not allow to make forked repositories private. So instead **duplicate** the repository as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/duplicating-a-repository). You will first create your new repository and then follow the 4 steps under "Mirroring a repository".
* Invite the course GitHub user, `MATH2504-staff-2025` as a collaborator. You may do so early on while working on the project, and you must do this no later than the project due date. You must verify that `MATH2504-staff-2025` is a collaborator on your project and let the course staff know if that is not the case. . It is your duty to check that we accepted the invite (give us 2-5 working days to accept the invite).
* Do **not** make any changes (commits) to the repo after the project due date.
* Create a local clone of the repo. It is recommended that use use `git` command line via the shell to work on making changes/additions to the assignment and submitting the changes. However you are free to use any other mechanism (VS-Code, GitHub desktop, etc). Making intermediate commits is certainly recommended.
 
Your GitHub repo should be formatted like the original repo that you forked with additional files and modifications based on the tasks below.
 
* Note: make sure that there aren't any excessive files in your submission repo. An exception is perhaps a Jupyter `.ipynb` file if you choose to use it for creating the PDF. Use a `.gitignore` file to ensure `git` does not commit additional files and output files to your `repo`.
 
 
## Project tasks (90pts)
 
Build your project on top of the [https://github.com/dietmaroelz/2504\_2025\_project1](https://github.com/dietmaroelz/2504_2025_project1) by making modifications, additions, and improvements. Your first goal is to understand every bit of code of the basic repository. After that, you will make improvements, additions, and cleanups.
 
Please follow the suggested type names below. These are suggested so that tasks have backwards compatibility which mean you do not throw away old code, but rather add modifications. Note that in an actual project, you would sometimes replace older types with newer ones, and/or use parametric types.
 
### **Task 1 (15 pts) - Working in an existing codebase**
### Getting it to run, improving pretty printing, and creating your own example script.
 
 
#### Study the Repo
Once you create your own repository, first read the file `README.md`. Then make sure the repository works by running `test/runtests.jl` and `example_script.jl`. At this point simply study the functionality of the repository by looking at the function signatures (not implementations) to understand what the repo can do.
 
 
#### Create Example Scripts
Create your own example script called `example_script_task_1.jl` and include polynomials for illustrating the key functionality of the operations available via the software. Your script should run and demonstrate (using `println` or `@show`) how the code in the repository works. Namely:

1.  construct *three* polynomials (say `f`, `g`, and `h`) using the given constructors for `PolynomialDense`,
2.  compute `f + g`, `f * h`, `g * h`, and `gcd(f*h, g*h)`,
3.  compute `derivative(f * g)` and show it is equal to what is expected when utilizing product rule,
4.  compute `(f * h) \div h` modulo 3, 7 and 101, and confirm using `mod` (in `polynomial_dense.jl`) that `f` modulo 3, 7, and 101 is returned.
    
Basically, `example_script_task_1.jl` is an improvement over the minimally supplied `example_script.jl`. *Make sure to screenshot (or copy/paste) the output of `example_script_task_1.jl` at this stage to include in your submission.*
 
#### Pretty Printing
Improve the "pretty printing" of the polynomials by incorporating the following rules:

5.  Terms of zero degree (i.e., constants) should exclude `x^0`, e.g. `2` not `2x^0`.
6.  Terms with unit degree should exclude the degree, e.g. `3x` not `3x^1`.
7.  Excluding the constant term `1`, terms with unit coefficient should exclude the coefficient, e.g. `3x^2 + x` not `3x^2 + 1x`.
8.  Use subtraction instead of adding negative terms, e.g. `3x^2 - 2x` not `3x^2 + -2x`.
9.  Display the terms in *descending* degree order. $a_n \cdot x^n + a_n \cdot x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$.
10.  Do not print terms with zero coefficients, e.g. `x^2 + 1` not `x^2 + 0 x^1 + 1`.


### **Task 2 (22 pts) - Utilising Julia's type system**
### Parameterize the coefficient type to utilize `BigInt`
   
#### Showing overflow for `PolynomialDense`
Exact computation requires polynomials with (truly) integer coefficients and thereby we must use `BigInt` rather than (the finitely many integers comprising) `Int`. 
  
1. Create a new script called `example_script_task_2.jl`. Demonstrate using five hard-coded examples (i.e, explicitly write out the polynomials and do not use `rand` to generate them) of `PolynomialDense` addition that will overflow by making the coefficients (*not the degree*) excessively large.

#### Parameterising `Polynomial`
Notice that the struct `Term` is already parameterised and can accept coefficients and degrees that are `BigInt`s. However, the `Polynomial` and `PolynomialDense` types default to using `Int` for both. Your task is to refactor (i.e., modify) these types to be parametric as follows:
 
2.  Refactor `Polynomial` to accept two type parameters called `C` and `D` respectively. I.e., we should have `abstract type Polynomial{C, D} end`.

3. Refactor all functions in the file `src/polynomial_definitions/polynomial.jl` to account for these new parameters.  *Note: you may create a number of type `T` by writing, for example, `T(5)`. The methods `zero(T)` and `one(T)` can create 0 and 1 of type `T`.*

4. Refactor all functions in the folder `src/abstract` to account for these new parameters.

#### Parameterising `PolynomialDense`
5. At this stage the `PolynomialDense` implementation will no longer work. Refactor the type `PolynomialDense` to accept two type parameters `C`, `D` such that the struct definition starts with `struct PolynomialDense{C, D} <: Polynomial{C, D}`. `PolynomialDense` should then store it's terms in a vector of type `Vector{Term{C, D}}`.

6. Refactor all methods in the file `src/polynomial_definitions/polynomial_dense.jl` to account for these new parameters.

7. Refactor all functions in the folder `src/dense` to account for these new parameters.

At this stage we should be able to instantiate a polynomial of type `PolynomialDense{BigInt, Int}`. We need to verify it works correctly. *Note: do not try and instantiate a polynomial of type `PolynomialDense{BigInt, BigInt}` or `PolynomialDense{Int, BigInt}`. These may create absurdly large arrays.*

#### Checking it works
8.  Refactor your script `example_script_task_2.jl` to demonstrate that your five original hard-coded examples fail (i.e., produce obviously incorrect output) for `PolynomialDense{Int, Int}` but are correct when run using `PolynomialDense{BigInt, Int}` (ie, do not overflow).

9.  Create 10 random tests for `PolynomialDense{BigInt, Int}` (at the end of your `example_script_task_2.jl`. Ensure your implementation for `PolynomialDense{BigInt, Int}` passes your tests. 

10. Include the output of `example_script_task_2.jl` in your PDF submission.
  
### **Task 3 (13 pts) - Refactoring the data structure used**
 
The current implementation for `PolynomialDense` uses a vector to store the term of degree $k$ at position $k+1$. This is optimal for dense polynomials (those with mostly *nonzero* coefficients) but our factoring algorithms rely heavily on manipulating *sparse polynomials* like $x^n -1$. In this task we address this deficiency:
 
#### Constructors:
1.  Navigate to the folder `src/polynomial_definitions` and duplicate the file `polynomial_dense.jl` as the file `polynomial_sparse.jl`.

2.  Inside `polynomial_sparse.jl` rename all instances of `PolynomialDense` to `PolynomialSparse` and refactor (ie. modify) the inner constructor of `PolynomialSparse` so that non-zero terms are excluded from storage.  Utilize the [max heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) (which you can find in `src/utils/heap.jl`) ordered by term degree to accomplish this.

3.  Refactor the *constructors* and *functions* in `polynomial_sparse.jl` to account for the new underlying representation.  For example, `mod` can no longer utilise array indexing.

#### Operations
4.  Navigate to the folder `src/basic_polynomial_operations` and duplicate the folder `dense` as the folder `sparse`.

5.  Refactor the *operations* in `src/basic_polynomial_operations/sparse` to account for the new underlying representation.  For example, `add` can no longer be done with simple vector addition. 
  
*Note: sparse term multiplication and addition can be optimised significantly. You should override both these functions for your `PolynomialSparse` implementation.*
 
#### Checking it works
7.  Replicate the `example_script_task_2.jl` for `PolynomialSparse` in a file called `example_script_task_3.jl`.

8.  Describe three pros and/or cons (in a table in your PDF) between the dense and sparse representations.

9.  Show (using [`BenchmarkTools`](https://juliaci.github.io/BenchmarkTools.jl/stable/)) that there are examples where `PolynomialSparse` outperforms `PolynomialDense` for both time and memory usage.  *Do this only for cases where `PolynomialSparse` and `PolynomialDense` do not overflow.*

10. Include the output of `example_script_task_3.jl` in your PDF submission.
    
### **Task 4 (7pts) - Optimising an algorithm**
#### Fixing power

As discussed in class, if you have a polynomial `f` and raise it to the power `2^n` then instead of doing about `2^n` multiplications you can do about `n` using **repeated squaring**.

1. Re-factor `pow_mod` and `^` into something more efficient by using repeated squaring.  Your implementation should be implemented at the abstract level (i.e.,`Polynomial{C, D}`) and should therefore  work for both `PolynomialDense` and `PolynomialSparse`.

2. Augment (i.e., modify) your algorithms (`pow_mod` and `^`) such that the operations `0^n`, `1^n` and `x^n` occur in constant time.
 
3. Create a file `tests/power_test.jl`. Inside of this file create tests for `pow_mod` and `^`. Ensure your implementations pass these tests.

4. Have your tests print some output demonstrating the correctness of your `pow_mod` and `^` functions *Screenshot (or copy/paste) the output and add it to your PDF submission`*
 
### **Task 5 (13pts) - A new coefficient type**
#### Creating `ZModP` TODO

# TODO
Notice the `PolynomialDense`, `PolynomialSparse`, and `PolynomialSparseBI` data-types have integer coefficients whereas operations such as `divide`, `gcd`, and `factor` require the coefficient arithmetic to be done modulo $p$.  Consequently, the aforementioned functions must be performed in $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ and not in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and worse yet can only do so once a prime $p$ is provided.  It is for this reason that `divide`, `gcd`, and `factor` return a function that returns a polynomial only once a $p$ is provided.  It would be much cleaner to have a polynomial datatype where the "mod p" behavior is "baked in" and automated.
 
-  [WITH ABSTRACTION] Create a type `PolynomialModP` which has a polynomial (of type `PolynomialSparse`) and a prime number (`Int`) as field names.  `PolynomialModP` should support the same arithmetic operations as `PolynomialSparse` but with coefficient arithmetic over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ rather than `Int`. `PolynomialModP` should be easier to work with when carrying out division, gcd, and factorization. So for example `f1 ÷ f2` where `f1` and `f2` are of type `PolynomialModP`, would directly yield a new `PolynomialModP` which is the result mod $p$. Similarly for the other operations. 
 
- Create tests for `PolynomialModP` and associated functions and ensure your implementation passes them.
 
Your new datatype should rely on the existing functionality of `PolynomialSparse` but restrict the coefficients to $0$, $1$, \ldots, $p-1$.
 
Once you complete this task, certain operations of `PolynomialSparseBI` like `p1 ÷ p2`, are now better done via `PolynomialModP`. That is, while you may use `f1 ÷ f2` for `f1` and `f2` of types `PolynomialSparseBI`, it is better to only `÷` when `f1` and `f2` are of type `PolynomialModP` because you get back an instance of `PolynomialModP` rather than a function.
 
-  Implement `^` for `PolynomialModP` and update the `pow_mod` function to use it.
 
-  Update the `show` method for `PolynomialModP` to include an indication it is "mod p".
 
### Task 6 (22pts) - Improving multiplication using the Chinese Remainder Theorem TODO
 
The current multiplication implementation is not efficient for `PolynomialSparseBI` because big integer arithmetic is expensive.  In this task we reconcile this problem by using CRT to compute products of `PolynomialSparseBI` via cheaper products of `PolynomialSparse`.
 
- Implement multiplication for `PolynomialModP` (if you haven't done so yet in Task 4).
 
- Implement multiplication using the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** (CRT) for `PolynomialSparseBI` as presented in the lecture. Here the product of two `PolynomialSparseBI`s will be computed by doing sufficiently many multiplications of their `PolynomialModP` counterparts.
 
- Create tests for `PolynomialSparseBI` CRT multiplication and ensure your implementation passes them.
 
- Benchmark `PolynomialSparseBI` CRT multiplication and contrast your results against the old multiplication (it is recommended to keep the old form of multiplication in another function or method).  Find examples that demonstrate the CRT based approach is faster.
 
#### Factoring TODO
 
- Adapt the supplied polynomial factorization code to incorporate the new methods and types you have built up to this point. The current supplied code works for limited cases but may get stuck on certain examples.
 
-  Create tests for factorization and ensure your implementation passes them.  It is a good idea to pass your factorization algorithm a product of polynomials so your factorization is predictable.  Note that your factorization algorithm may fail on small primes due to bad luck. It is therefore best to choose large primes.
 
-  Benchmark your factorization algorithm by factoring a database of problems (e.g. generated by you via `rand`).  Do not use more than 120 seconds of local compute time.
 
-  Using a compute budget of approximately 120 seconds "stress test" your factorization implementation by factoring something substantial.
 
### **Bonus Tasks**
***Note:*** no help will be given via the Ed discussion board or otherwise for bonus tasks. Bonus tasks may add to your marks, although you are still capped at 100%. I.e., if you get 94/100 for normal tasks and 7/10 for bonus tasks you will get 100/100 (*not 101/100*).
